    "The primary purpose of this dataset is to determine a person's age based on their bone structure examined in an x-ray. The real value of this is determining how mature a person's skeleton is to determine if the patient has any perceptible growth defects, especially for children. For example, if a person's skeleton indicates that they should be 7 years old, but they are in fact 10, they are likely suffering from some sort of endocrine disorder. However, there are not many good quantitative measures for this, even fewer of which are fast and fully automated.\n",

    "If a prediction algorithm were able to compute the age of a person's skeleton based on their x-ray data, that is enough to determine whether they are suffering from endocrine dysfunction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This test does not need to be perfect, but it should do a reasonable job at predicting the presence or absence of endocrine dysfuntion. In particular, this form of testing should serve as a basic, first-pass screen, so that hospitals can save money on doing more costly, but more precise, tests on each individual. As a basic screening technique, when predicting whether or not someone's bones are inside or outside of the tolerable range of their age, we should prioritze decreasing the false negative rate to decreasing the false positive rate. It is always easier to run a patient through extra tests to find out that they aren't affected than it is to turn away a patient who is affected."
